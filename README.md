### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2023

+ Projec title: Comparison of Happy Moments for Different Kinds of People and Under Different Time Horizons
+ This project is conducted by yinpei wang.

+ Project summary: In this analysis, I explore patterns and trends in HappyDB, searching for insights among the stars of positivity. Using tools like word frequencies and sentiment analysis, I uncover variations in happy moments between different groups of people and across timeframes. Specifically, I compare the joyful moments of females versus males, married versus unmarried individuals, parents versus the childless, and experiences over the past 24 hours versus the past 3 months. The findings reveal fascinating contrasts in the sources of happiness across demographics and periods of time. Married folk derive bliss from family time, while the unmarried are more likely to experience childlike glee. Women tend to find joy in relationships and pleasures, while male happiness skews towards self-satisfaction and leisure activities. Parents bask in their children's glow, whereas the childless are more self-focused. And recent joy derives from sharable moments, while satisfaction from the past quarter year comes from achievements.
